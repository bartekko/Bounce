A simple project I made to learn Unity.

Controls:
Middle Mouse Button - Create a Massive Body at cursor location
Left Mouse Button - Start drawing a line at cursor location 
mousewheel up/down - Change size and mass of Massive Body currently pointed at.
Q/W - Change ball Spawn Rate
A/S - Change gravity
